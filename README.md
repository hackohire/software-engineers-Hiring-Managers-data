There is a chrome extension called linkedin sales navigator. we need to add that to our chrome web browser. Then we need to login to
Linkedin account as well as gmail account. if we type any email in compose box then it will display the linkedin profile. For each
Linkedin account we can do 2000 searches. so if we have 100 linkedin accounts we can get a chance to search for 2 lakh email addresses.

1) Input (Publicly available email addresses)
2) output (lid, location, headline, designation, company, firstname, lastname)
3) need to add linkedin cookie at headers variable in the code.
4) after we get the data of software engineers/hiring managers, we can invite them in linkedin itself by using lid or by using
their email addresses.
5) Here, i have taken linkedin exists status based on location. Due to we need location for the people as mentioned in the problem statement.
